 Assignment 1

Hello World! Jokes asides. My name is Yusha Soc and first and foremost the reason 
I am taking this course is to be familiarized more with how everything runs meaning loops, arrays, functions, etc. 
I will enjoy this class mainly because I've always found it in my best interest to learn the fundamentals and from there move onto advanced topics. 
I look forward to passing the class hopefully and being able to take CS121 where'll take on C++. 
I would love to receive feedback on how I can better practice. I do have some knowledge of Raspberry Pi and I do enjoy working with them.
I hope to learn minor details in this class that I had not known of.

## Assignment 2

In Assignment 2 I learned how to create a Flowgorithm plan as well as being familiarized with the software itself "flowgorithm". 
Within there I made three separate files one in a txt document, another in fprg or known as Flowgorithm data file and another in Python code all three files 
showed and ran successfully Hello (my name)! I plan on using the software VSC or known as Visual Studio Code. As I am somewhat familiar with it. 
I intend on sticking with this throughout the course.

## Assignment 3

As we have reached midway through the semester, I can confidently state that this particular activity and assignment has been my favorite so far. 
Engagement in this project has been deeply fulfilling, and sharing my progress with my colleagues has been a gratifying experience. 
Despite encountering challenges with setting variables for calculations and encountering incorrect outputs, I am determined to find solutions.

One aspect I aim to enhance is the appearance of my calculations. To accomplish this,
I have decided to declare the dollar sign as a string variable, which I have assigned as "$". 
This change will make the output appear more professional. Furthermore, 
I aim to expand the project by incorporating taxes and allowing the user to select their location,
such as the US or EU, to account for variations in currency symbols. By doing so, 
I hope to address the issue of diverse currencies and provide a more comprehensive solution in determining their gross pay.
To achieve these objectives, I have sought assistance from Tabish Sultan and have been asking my coworkers for advice on how to improve.

## Assignment 4 

First and foremost. For this week's assignment, 
I typed and viewed the program plan in pseudocode to understand the requirements and the steps involved in writing my code.
The pseudocode included statements like "Input the length and width of the room", "Calculate the area of the room", and 
"Determine the amount of floor covering needed based on the area of the room". Next, I referred to my previous assignment to see if I have already 
implemented similar lines of code into this new code or if I would use it as an example almost. This would help me to avoid running into issues.
This week I also had written independent Python code. Overall, by combining my understanding of the program plan in pseudocode and my previous experience, 
I would be able to write Python code to calculate the area of a room and determine the amount of floor covering needed efficiently and effectively.
